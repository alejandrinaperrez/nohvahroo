Увеличьте конверсию, наполнив магазин описаниями, продающими текстами Hello, I am looking to replace my dying Nokia C7 and can spend 200$ on a new(er) unlocked device. I should note that I dislike most new phones due to them being too big for me, the mentioned trio seem to be pretty compact and pack a punch. These are interesting options that came up in my research, am I missing anything? Pantech Burst: +1.5 Ghz Dual-Core processor(fastest) +Official ICS -No custom roms community it appears(no xda forum) so will be stuck with whatever android version. У большинства авторитетных изданий, которые делали обзор новинки, Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini получил довольно позитивные отзывы. I installed lineageos 16 on my sony xperia xa2 an hour ago but i forgot to put the google apps on there. I tried to temporarily boot twrp to reinstall lineageos with the google apps. But when i go into the bootloader now fastboot doesn't recognize my phone. Im stuck on the "waiting for devices" message. Its probaly a driver issue but i dont know what to do. I hope you guys can help me. Thanks in advance (sorry for my English).

This is not about the several crashing bugs introduced with the same version, but about the inconsistent frame rate bug on certain Android devices. While looking for a solution (one of my devices is affected), I found out that apparently this bug was not caused by the development team of Dragalia; it's actually an issue with the Unity Game Engine, which Dragalia uses. It only occurs when the multithreaded rendering setting is enabled (apparently the Dragalia team decided to enable it starting. This post isn’t meant to offend anyone, or say that Apple is superior/Android is faulty etc. It’s to share my thoughts and have a discussion on things that Google/Android needs to improve on. Some background: - I just started using an iPhone Xs Max as my “daily driver” smartphone (in October) - I’ve been using Android smartphones as my primary smartphone/“daily driver” for the past 8 years - My recent Android smartphone history includes: Note9, Galaxy S9+, Galaxy S9, LG G7, Sony XPERIA I'm looking to replace my Xperia Z5 Compact with a new Xperia. The Z5 doesn't not support Wifi calling or VoLTE, which in my new place I need to get calls. I want another Xperia mainly for the audio quality and the SD card slot. I have a pair of Sony XBA-N3AP and Sony MDR-1ADAC headphones that sound great out of the Xperia (and the 1ADAC may not work with a different phone as it is USB and has an internal DAC driver that I know Sony will support), and all my music is on the SD card as I general.  For now, this guide is ANDROID ONLY, but it might include more solutions for more Operating Systems and versions over time, I’m trying to keep this GUIDE up-to-date and I’m happy for any contributing posts that I can include in this post. I’m not a native English speaker, so please excuse my grammar and wording if it’s incorrect, you can – of course, correct me in all the things (regarding content and grammar/wording), ideally by PM so you don’t bloat the thread with it. First, we start. 
For the past month or so, I've been having problems with my Bluetooth connection in certain areas. I think this is happening because of interfering wireless signals. Basically whatever I'm listening to becomes choppy and cuts out intermittently until it suddenly corrects itself. I notice it when I'm near other cars (particularly when stopped at intersections) or even when I get home and back in range of Wi-Fi. I thought at first it was due to competing BT signals since it was happening at inters. My 8BitDo Zero Connects fine to my Win10 laptop trough bluetooth, but when trying to connect it via a usb cable, it says "unknown usb device (device descriptor request failed)". I've tried different cables and usb ports, uninstalled the driver for the device, tried different gamepad modes and restarted my laptop, but to no use. Another problem is when i try to connect it to my Android 4.0.4 Sony Xperia Tipo, my phone recognises the controller and "succesfully" connects to it, but my controller. Hello everyone. As the title says, case's USB ports 3.0 don't recognize my phone at all, only motherboard's USB ports recognize it. The phone is Sony Xperia Z3. The front panel's USB cable is properly attached to the motherboard, there's no problem with that. All drivers are up to date. USB power options are on the mode, where USB ports are still active even when the PC is turned off. It's a bit annoying though, and i'd happily turn it off, but i think it's a motherboard's feature, which I’ve been ride-sharing for about 2 years and went through some phones, the first one, Chinese made Asus phone that was not able to read my SIM card after awhile. The second one was a Sony Xperia ultra that had a bad gps antenna. Reluctant to buy a new iPhone at the time I decided to use my old galaxy s4 which was working fine until year ago it crashed and a bought a iPhone 5s. (cheapest option at the time 0) It’s been working flawlessly with the app until a week ago. Last week I started I have 2 phones. (Phone 1: Moto E2 - https://m.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_e_(2nd_gen)-6986.php ) (Phone 2: Xperia Z3 Compact (https://m.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_z3_compact-6538.php)) Both were released around the same time, and Phone 2 has better general specs than Phone 1. Phone 1, however, can get a lock on its GPS even in Airplane Mode. Phone 2's GPS will certainly not function in Airplane Mode, and struggles to ever do as well at locating as Phone 1, even under normal conditions. 
I've left windows phone. Leaving windows phone became easier every day, finding a replacement wasn't. A struggle a lot of you are facing. Let me share my experience. I was using a lumia 950XL until the start of 2019. It started out very promising for windows phone, but it seemed as if it became worse with every update. I reinstalled it with the microsoft tools multiple times, but it had strange behaviour. When switching apps that use audio, like from edge with youtube playing, to music I own a pair of stock T50RP mk3's that I bought a year ago for 0 on ebay.

My daily driver is a Galaxy S7 but i'm searching for a second phone for my job.I know that the A series is pretty much what i'm searching for but I had some phone in mind like the Xperia XA2,Moto G6(no nfc is meh)Z3 Play and LG G7 one and i'm open to recommendation. Phone need: Headphone jacks,NFC and atleast Android 7. Not a huge chinese phone guy but if the deal is good i'm open(One Plus 6 for exemple looks good and is availaible in Canada). Hi everybody, i am trying to install lineage os on my sony xperia xa2. i did everything as described here https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/pioneer/install (https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/pioneer/install) but i always end up with this error: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Error applying Update: 18 (ErrorCode:: kdownlo. 
I've flashed AttoDriver V2.0 in my Xperia PLAY via CWM, but when the system booteda lot of apps just didn't work. Maybe because my model is R800a and Atto is made for R800x, idk. Now when I try to boot to recovery mode or flashboot mode, pressing the search button and inserting the USB cable, it just boots into the system. Only flashmode works, after I press back button, but I can't do anything with that. Already tried to "boot into recovery" in quick boot app and in flashtools Hello, I just bought the Z5C (low price on Amazon, less than 200€), and unlocking bootloader to install LineageOS fails ("FAILED - Remote - Command did not succeed" on the fastboot command). Bootloader unlock allowed is set to Yes, and Software version is : 1295-6639\_32.0.A.6.200. Z5C is running Android 5.1.1, and no update are available from Settings. On Sony website, providing IMIE number, same result : system is up to date. After some research, I found that thread : https://talk.sony. As I understand, only Sony Xperia phones have official AOSP support, ie. official complete fully-tested build instructions with periodical updates (if that's not the case, please tell me!): https://developer.sony.com/develop/open-devices/guides/aosp-build-instructions/ Do the Xperia AOSP builds include anything proprietary that's not mandatory ie. closed source apps etc. (not drivers)? Nexus and Pixel phones seem not to have official support, but have reliable support and unofficial guides. Hey folks. I've got a strange situation with my virtualized Debian server. I have a ZBox CI327 running ESXi 6.7 with 4 VMs. I enabled passthrough for the internal WiFi card Intel (Dual Band Wireless AC 3165) and assigned that card to my Debian server. I installed successfully the driver (firmware-iwlwifi) and can scan my local wifi networks, so the card itself is working in Debian. I bridged the ethernet port with the wifi interface. Now I installed hostapd and configured it properly. 
I'm not really sure about this new "15.1 daily, 14.1 monthly" update scheme. When I first read news about this update schedule change, I immediately didn't understand nor really like the decision. It's not like the Oreo builds are just freshly coming out and there are lots of bugs to be fixed. Changelogs are being emptier and emptier every week, both because there are less bugs to be fixed, and also because (I believe) developers focused their attention to LOS 16.0 based on Pie. It's quite ironi. I've been using my new Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium as a daily driver for roughly one and a half months and believe that I might answer some questions related to the phone. If anyone is interested, drop down a question and I'll do my best to answer it! (For the record I'm new to Reddit so I'm not that familiar with the UI and how you navigate through Reddit but I'll do my best.). hi again, i'm looking for a portable amp or dac/amp for my IEM's and over-ears. source: sony xperia l1 (budget smartphone) over-ear: Sennheisr HD 598 SR IEM's: audio technica ATH COR150iS ; but i may get klipsch r6 ii or 1more triple driver soon(based on good reviews). again, my problem, like i mentioned in my previous posts is: i listen mostly to classical music, wich is recorded very quietly (some say this is good), so i needed to buy an AMP/DAC (fiio e10k) to drive my 598's when liste. Hello guys, My daily driver Sony Xperia Z1c is going mad lately (battery is discharging fast, some weird lock screen issues and so on - I have it for 3 years now :D) so.I am considering of buying a new phone and since clean Android is my focus, I find out this one. I watched and read some reviews, and.most of the time, there were complains about the optimization of the system. Like, app crashes and so. Was this fixed by some OTAs or so? :) Also, since.
