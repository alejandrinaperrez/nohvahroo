                            <p>Falcon Heavy is one of those things that, at first, sounded easy. We’ll just take two first stages and use them as strap-on boosters. Actually, no, this is crazy hard, and it required the redesign of the center core and a ton of different hardware. Удобная таблица с описанием всех предметов из игры Binding of Isaac Rebirth, а также дополнений Afterbirth и Afterbirth † (Afterbirth Plus). Моей милой бабушке Зое посвящается… А дом еще хранит твое тепло, О, сколько было в нем уюта и покоя. Am I crazy or there is no Oculus demo in BB Canada stores. 
My first headset was a Rift DK2 back in 2015. At the time there was a website full of really creative demos and experiences to try (such as the Tuscany house). Do these demos still exist online somewhere? If so, has anyone tried Over the past several months, I’ve had to travel quite a bit. Despite the protests of my family, who have been to one demo too many, they patiently accompany me to every Best Buy with a demo station. After discovering that many stations have already been closed or might continue to be closed, I have a few suggestions for whatever important person at Oculus might come across this post. Things that don’t work: - Do NOT leave the demo station. - Don’t tell the customer that you prefer the Vive. Is it possible to play the oculus demos via WMR device. Now granted this was just a demo but not impressed, especially with WMR. Tracking was spot on with Oculus but the headset felt janky and the visuals were on par with PSVR, not any better. WMR tracking felt off and the game I played was some Pirate BS that felt like it was for Gear VR. Hats off to Sony. For the money PlayStation VR is King. It was funny too. The Windows rep was saying a bunch of BS how WMR is for things like excel sheets and that they are trying to cater to women. It was bizarre. Hello /r/WarThunder. My father-in-law is visiting for Thanksgiving and I plan on giving him a good overview of VR experiences. One gap in my 'demo lineup' is a well-conceived terrestrial flight sim, and I think War Thunder might be perfect. Can anybody please tell me if it's possible to set up a simple test-flight type scenario where he can pick from a few aircraft, check the cockpits out, and then do a takeoff without having to worry about any enemies? It looks like I have to unlock aircr. 
 We're having a games night at work on Wednesday. I work at a software developer. We have a lot of gamers here, but most haven't tried VR, or they have only tried cardboard and think VR is a passing fad. Myself and a collegue are bringing in our Rifts to demo. I want to convince people of VR, but will onyl have about 15 minutes per person. Right now I'm thinking touch tutorial followed by First contact, then give non gamers Google earth VR or toybox, and gamers roborecall or superhot. A little background: My boss wanted me to bring in my computer to present a VR demo to our host company who recently acquired us. I spent a long time curating free content to present to them to secure their interest in investing time in developing new software. The day before this demo, we had a meeting where there were a lot of awkward silences, so I connected to our communal bluetooth speaker and played a couple of orgasm sounds from spotify. I work on a team of engineers that laugh about. It would be amazing if someone could create a wrapper for this as it would open the door to literally hundreds of demos and games we've been using over the past couple of years. I know CrossVr is a very busy man trying to help with Runtime 1.4+, but I'm sure there are more people out their with the technical know-how to achieve this. I'd love to see a discussion about the feasibility first, I've seen so many knowledgeable people here on /r/Vive. You know what's an anomaly ? When you demo the Rift (Dk2 amp Leap motion) to someone and they have no reaction. Not even 'cool'. It baffles me. It's extremely rare but I demo'd blocks with the Orion software to my friend and it was his first time in VR. He was aware of the Oculus Rift and knew what VR was. He didn't seem particularly impressed or anything. In fact he seemed completely underwhelmed like what he just experienced was an every day thing. He had no comments about the experience. Edit: Ok, I found out how to run old demo's, but I cannot find welcome to oculus to download from anywhere. DK1 had 'Tuscany' (and Riftcoaster), DK2 had. errr, a table with a plant pot ;-) So some cool dude made 'Welcome to Oculus'. So will there be one with CV1? And what might I'm doing my PhD in psychological VR research and was asked to hold a demonstration for some students in a seminar. Therefore I'm looking for a good Oculus demo, that is a) short about 2 min , b) nothing scary and not nausea inducing, c) not requiring complicated input as that would take too much time to explain, and d) awesome of course! . Any ideas? btw.: I will be using 
So, I just got the chance to try the Oculus Demo in Berlin and here are my first quick impressions: I already own a CV1 but I am having problems with image clarity and what seems to be smudges on the inside of the lens, that's why I wanted to try another unit to see if this is a general problem. The demo units are very nicely set up, they even let you adjust the headset fit and the IPD slider, also when I put on the headset I noticed a quite different Been a while since I dusted off my DK2 and want to show it off. I know tons of new stuff is on Stream now and it's not just silly little demos any more. What are some must-buys cool games to really show off the power At the big unveiling of the Oculus Quest at Oculus Connect 5, it was announced that there will be at least 50 launch titles available for the new VR platform.
